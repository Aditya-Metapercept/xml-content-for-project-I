      <p>The <uicontrol>Workflow Management</uicontrol> feature enables you to perform the following: </p>
      <ul>
         <li>Automate business processes for granting approvals andclearances using pre-defined templates and configurable workflows to eliminate inconsistencies and errors. You can also change a pre-defined business process to suit your organizationalneeds.</li>
         <li>Integrate with the Form Builder or XML, allowing you to automate any businessprocess. </li>
         <li>Define new workflows and modify existing workflowsfor custom-created XML forms and in-built forms. </li>
      </ul>
      <p>User role permission is defined at two levels. The first level of permission is given at the form level, and the second level of permission is given at the workflow level. </p>
      <ul>
         <li>Workflow-level permissions are given on top of form-level permissions. For example, a user role with <uicontrol>Edit</uicontrol> permission at the form level and action stakeholder permission at the workflow level can only perform workflow action. A user role with <uicontrol>Edit</uicontrol> permission at the form level and view stakeholder permission at the workflow level cannot perform workflow action and can only view the record. A user role that does not have <uicontrol>Edit</uicontrol> permission at the form level can still perform workflow action if the workflow is enabled for <uicontrol>Allow Workflow Action by All Stakeholders</uicontrol>.<note> If a role is not selected as view or action stakeholder, then that role will not be able to view any records irrespective of their form level permission.</note>
         </li>
         <li>Workflow level permission options (action/view stakeholder) allow you to configure user role access at every workflow stage based on the business process requirement.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>The <xref scope="local" href="#ListPage_WORKFLW/WFTerminologies">Terminologies Used in Workflow Builder</xref>sectiondescribes in detailthe various features of the <ph href="../../../../Warehouse/Product_Name_Warehouse.xml#reference-9043/product_name"/>workflow engine.</p>
      <p>The <xref href="CreateWF.xml">Creating a Workflow</xref> section describes the procedure to create a basic workflow.</p>
      <p>Post creating a basic workflow, based on the complexity of the business process, you can use either of the following ways  to create a workflow:</p>
      <ul>
         <li>
            <xref href="CreateWFSimple.xml">Create a workflow using simple mode</xref> – The simple mode has limited functionality to create a workflow. Using simple mode, you can customize a pre-created workflow, add the required additional stages, define conditions, validations, and so on. </li>
         <li>
            <xref href="CreateWFAdv.xml">Create a workflow using advanced mode</xref> – Using advanced mode, you can create a complex workflow. Advanced mode enables you to use advanced features such as expressions, condition block, morph workflow, get form data, set form data, create  a new form, call form resource, set form status, set due date, set stakeholders, and so on.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>The following section describes the procedure to configure business logic within a workflow:</p>
      <ul product="Exclude_PG_Content">

         <title>Before You Begin - Terminologies Used in Workflow Management</title>
         <p>You can easily use the Workflow Management utility to create workflows for various forms. However, before you start creating them, here are some terminologies you should be familiar with:</p>
         <ul>
            <li>
               <uicontrol>Stage</uicontrol>: A stage forms the building block of a workflow. A workflow can be broadly defined as a collection of stages logically associated with each other with predefined actions defined at every stage. There is no limit to the number of stages you can have in a workflow and the numberof actions that can be associated with them. Stages can be broadly classified into three types: Start stage, Intermediate stage, and End stage. It is important to define stages and associate them with their respective stages in a workflow for ease of use.</li>
            <li>
               <uicontrol>Simple Activities</uicontrol> and <uicontrol>Dynamic Activities</uicontrol>: An activity enables you to plug any action into the <ph href="../../../../Warehouse/Product_Name_Warehouse.xml#reference-9043/product_name"/> workflow engine. The configurable actions include flow control blocks such as <uicontrol>if</uicontrol> and <uicontrol>if-else</uicontrol>. Actions enable you to change the value of business objects, create new business objects, and so on.  <ph href="../../../../Warehouse/Product_Name_Warehouse.xml#reference-9043/product_name"/> enables you to configure various events or actions through activities. In the Advanced mode, you can access these events or actions using the <uicontrol>Call Form Resource</uicontrol> Activity in the <uicontrol>Workflow</uicontrol> tab of the <uicontrol>NEW WORKFLOW</uicontrol> or <uicontrol>EDIT WORKFLOW</uicontrol>.</li>
            <li>
               <uicontrol>Action Stake Holders</uicontrol>: An action stakeholder is a user who can go and perform an action on the form. For a role to be available in the list of action stakeholders, the <uicontrol>Edit</uicontrol> permission must be enabled at the form level. Action stakeholder can be assigned at every stage of a workflow. For a role to perform an action on the form, role should have both <uicontrol>Edit</uicontrol> permission at the form level and selected as action stakeholder at the workflow stage level. Also, if a workflow is enabled for <uicontrol>Allow Workflow Action by All Stakeholders</uicontrol>, then all stakeholders with <uicontrol>Edit</uicontrol> or <uicontrol>View </uicontrol>or both permissions at the form level can perform workflow action.</li>
            <li>
               <uicontrol>View Stake Holders</uicontrol>: A view stakeholder is a user who can only view the form and cannot perform any action on the form. View stakeholders can be assigned at every stage of a workflow. If a workflow is enabled for <uicontrol>Allow Workflow Action by All Stakeholders</uicontrol>, then all stakeholders including the view stakeholders can perform workflow action. </li>
            <li>
               <uicontrol>Days to Complete</uicontrol>: This determines the number of days due for the nextaction to be performed by the next action stakeholder.</li>
            <li>
               <uicontrol>Action</uicontrol>: An action defined within a stage is a button that performs a set of actions,one of which can be transitioning a form from one stage to another. </li>
            <li>
               <uicontrol>Status</uicontrol>: The status is the name of the current workflowstage of the form. </li>
            <li>
               <uicontrol>Validation</uicontrol>: Workflows that are marked as <uicontrol>Validation</uicontrol> cannot be modified. You can create a copy of these workflows and then modify the copy as per your business needs. </li>
            <li>
               <uicontrol>Mark as Default</uicontrol>: In the <uicontrol>WORKFLOW LIST</uicontrol> page, you can set the selected workflow as the default workflow for a form. There could be more than one workflow defined for a single form, but only one workflow can be marked as default for a single form. When a workflow is not associated to a form, then that form will start using the workflow marked as default. </li>
            <li>
               <uicontrol>Pending On Role(s)</uicontrol>: This determines the user roles associated with the workflow that areyet to perform the next workflow action. In every stage, roles are displayed in the<uicontrol>Pending On</uicontrol>
               <uicontrol>Role(s)</uicontrol> column in the form list page, except the final stage. When the workflow is in the final stage, the <uicontrol>Pending On Role(s)</uicontrol> column is displayed as <uicontrol>None</uicontrol>.</li>
            <li>
               <uicontrol>Pending On User(s)</uicontrol>: This shows the names of the users that are assigned with the roles associated with the workflow that are yet to perform the next workflow action. In every stage, user names are displayed in the <uicontrol>Pending On User(s)</uicontrol> column in the form list page, except the final stage. When the workflow is in the final stage, the <uicontrol>Pending On User(s)</uicontrol> column is displayed as <uicontrol>None</uicontrol>.<note> The <uicontrol>Pending On User(s)</uicontrol> column is not displayed in the form list by default, you can click <uicontrol>Show Pending On User(s)</uicontrol> in the list page ribbon to display <uicontrol>Pending On User(s)</uicontrol> column in the form's list page.</note>
            </li>
