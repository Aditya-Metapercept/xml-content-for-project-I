      <p>Using the Ball in Court feature, you can forward form information to a user of the project to obtain more information or approvals. The Ball in Court feature is primarily used when a stakeholder at a particular workflow stage of a form needs to send form information to a user who is not a stakeholder at the workflow stage of the form. The user receiving the forwarded form information can then respond to the initiator with the required information.</p>
      <p>On initiating the ball in court utility in a form, a notificationemail is sent to the recipient, a notification is saved inthe<uicontrol>INBOX</uicontrol>page of the recipient, and atask created in the application<uicontrol>MY TASKS</uicontrol>page of the recipient. </p>
      <p>The recipient can then respond to the initiator from the form from which the ball in court utility was initiated. On responding to the ball in court notification in a form, a notificationemail is sent to the initiator anda notification is saved in the<uicontrol>INBOX</uicontrol>page of the initiator.</p>
      <p>The notification emailsent from the initiator and the response notification email sent from recipient are configurable in the workflow associated with the form. The notification email templates can be configured to contain custom information, and also form information.</p>
      <p>The high-level task sequence for the ball in court utility is as follows:</p>
      <p>
         <ol>
            <li>Configure notification templates in the <uicontrol>Mail Body Template</uicontrol> catalog of the Library.<ph product="Exclude_PG_Content">For information on configuring the Mail Body Template, refer to <xref href="../../Library_Management/Standard_Library_Catalogs/Notifications/MailBodyTemps.xml">Creating Mail Body Templates</xref>.</ph>
            </li>
            <li>Select the notification template to be sent to the recipient and the notification template to be sent to the initiator of the ball in court notification in the workflow of the form at the required workflow stage. <ph product="Exclude_PG_Content">For information on configuring email templates, refer to <xref href="../../Administration/Configuration_Toolkit/Workflow_Management/CreateWFSimple.xml">Configuring Ball in Court Notifications</xref>.</ph>
            </li>
            <li>Create the required form, and save the form.</li>
            <li>Use the Ball in Court notification in the form. The initiator template configured in the workflow is sent to the recipient.</li>
            <li>Use the Respond notification in the form that was used to initiate the Ball in Court notification. The recipient template configured in the workflow is sent to the initiator.</li>
         </ol>
      </p>
      <p>To illustrate the working of the Ball in Court feature, the Expenses Form is used as an example. The following topics describe the process to initiate a Ball in Court notification and respond to the notification:</p>
