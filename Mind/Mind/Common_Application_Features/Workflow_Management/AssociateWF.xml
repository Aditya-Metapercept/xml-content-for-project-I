      <context>Once a workflow is published as the default workflow for a form, every record of the form that is created in every project is associated with its default workflow. You can change the default workflow of a form. The newly associated workflow is effective for this form only in this project. New records created for this form in this project are associated with the newly selected workflow.</context>
      <ol>
         <li>
            <p>In the navigation pane, click a form to open.</p>
         </li>
         <li>
            <p>Click <uicontrol>Workflow</uicontrol>, and then click <uicontrol>Associate</uicontrol>.
</p>
            <p>The <uicontrol>Workflow Association</uicontrol> dialog box is displayed.
</p>
            <p>The <uicontrol>DEFAULT WORKFLOW</uicontrol> section displays the current associated default workflow of the form as defined for the form in the application. <ph product="Exclude_PG_Content">For information on workflow definitions, refer to <xref href="../../Administration/Configuration_Toolkit/Workflow_Management/WFMgmt.xml">Workflow Management</xref>.</ph>
            </p>
            <p>The <uicontrol>WORKFLOW OVERRIDE FOR THIS PAGE</uicontrol> section lists the current workflow that is associated with the form for the project. </p>
         </li>
         <li>
            <p>To associate a different workflow to the form in the project, from the <uicontrol>APPLY A NEW WORKFLOW FOR THIS LISTPAGE AND MODULE</uicontrol> drop-down box, select the workflow to associate with the form for the project.
</p>
            <p>Alternatively, to reset the workflow of the form for the project to the default workflow, as defined for the form in the application, in the <uicontrol>WORKFLOW OVERRIDE FOR THIS PAGE</uicontrol> section, click <uicontrol>Remove</uicontrol>.</p>
         </li>
         <li>
            <p>Click <uicontrol>Apply</uicontrol> to save the changes.
</p>
            <p>The workflow properties are associated with the form.
</p>
            <p>New records created for this form, for the project, are associated with the selected associated workflow.</p>
