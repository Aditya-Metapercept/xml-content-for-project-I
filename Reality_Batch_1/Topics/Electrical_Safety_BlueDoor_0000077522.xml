         <p>This manual contains important safety instructions that
should be followed during the installation and maintenance of the
UPS system.</p>

                     <sli>Electrical equipment must be installed, operated, serviced, and
maintained only by qualified personnel.</sli>
                     <sli>Apply appropriate personal protective equipment (PPE) and follow
safe electrical work practices.</sli>
                     <sli>Disconnection devices for AC and DC must be provided by others,
be readily accessible, and the function of the disconnect device marked
for its function.</sli>
                     <sli>Turn off all power supplying the UPS system before working on
or inside the equipment.</sli>
                     <sli>Before working on the UPS system, check for hazardous voltage
between all terminals including the protective earth.</sli>
                     <sli>The UPS contains an internal energy source. Hazardous voltage
can be present even when disconnected from the mains supply. Before
installing or servicing the UPS system, ensure that the units are
OFF and that mains and batteries are disconnected. Wait five minutes
before opening the UPS to allow the capacitors to discharge.</sli>
                     <sli>The UPS must be properly earthed/grounded and due to a high leakage
current, the earthing/grounding conductor must be connected first.</sli>

         <p id="WhenTheUPSInputIsConnectedThroughEx-E5439CD1">When the UPS input
is connected through external isolators that, when opened, isolate
the neutral or when the automatic backfeed isolation is provided external
to the equipment or is connected to an IT power distribution system,
a label must be fitted at the UPS input terminals, and on all primary
power isolators installed remotely from the UPS area and on external
access points between such isolators and the UPS, by the user, displaying
the following text (or equivalent in a language which is acceptable
in the country in which the UPS system is installed):</p>

Isolate the UPS and check for hazardous voltage between all terminals
including the protective earth.</howtoavoid>
