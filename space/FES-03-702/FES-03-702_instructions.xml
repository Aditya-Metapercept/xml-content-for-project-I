         <ol>
            <li>Before starting the work instruction activity, perform the following steps:<ol>
                  <li>Do not begin these tasks without confirmation that personnel directly involved have completed the required training associated with the work instruction activity and have reviewed this document.</li>
                  <li>Gather necessary tools and equipment as identified below in the Equipment Section</li>
                  <li>Wear and use additional Personal Protective Equipment (PPE) and safety equipment required for this specific work instruction. </li>
                  <li>Obey all applicable safety requirements and procedures.</li>
                  <li>Follow all Lockout/Tagout procedures when work instruction activity requires isolating energy in the designated area. Verify energy is isolated before starting work.</li>
               </ol>
            </li>
            <li>To ensure the functionality of the chute control system, perform the following steps: <note>
                  <p>These steps should be performed during preventative maintenance, shutdowns, job
                     changes, and/or production down time. These checks should be done often to
                     ensure the functionality of the chute control system.</p>
               </note>
               <p>Refer to drawings OIS-01410, OIS-01263, OIS-03002, OIS-03394,
                  OIS-03429</p>
               <p>A maintenance record has also been provided in the <xref href="FES-03-702_appendix.xml">Appendix</xref> to aid in logging operating
                  parameters and work performed on the pneumatic chute control system</p>
               <ol>
                  <li>Verify that the chute air supply is high pressure, dry (instrument) air. <note>
                        <p>On old installation drawings, 3.4 bar (50 psi) was specified. The new
                           standard is to supply 6.9 bar (100 psi) for chute air. </p>
                     </note>
                  </li>
                  <li>Verify that the air pressure switch tubing is connected prior to the check
                     valve and receiver tank (Reference the “L-P” airline on the above mentioned
                     drawings). <ol>
                        <li>Calibrate and set the pressure switch to 3.1 bar (45 psi).</li>
                        <li>Adjust the regulator to operate at 3.8 to 4.1 Bar (55 to 60 psi).</li>
                     </ol>
                  </li>
                  <li>Verify that the air hoses are not cut or damaged. <p>
                        <note id="note_mvn_c3g_rzb">
                           <p>Use braided stainless steel supply hoses, not rubber hoses.</p>

                  </li>
                  <li>Repair or replace the following solenoid valves, pressure switches, and
                     proximity switches once per year. The quantity and part number for each
                     component are shown below. <ol id="ol_jfd_rhg_rzb">
                        <li>1 shear lockout solenoid valve 115 VAC (HF-3556)</li>
                        <li>4 pressure switches 115 VAC (chute air, machine air, pilot air)
                           (OIS-204-665)</li>
                        <li>1 chute solenoid valve (OIS-204-499)</li>
                        <li>3 double pilot-operated 4-way valves (OIS-204-714)</li>
                        <li>2 Ross normally-closed poppet valves (OIS-204-1105-A)</li>
                        <li>1 direct solenoid actuated valve (OIS-204-1237)</li>
                     </ol>
                  </li>
                  <li>On the MICC 5480, MICC Laser, Flexdrive II, and Flexdrive III, there are two
                     ammeter relays: one for the feeder, and one for the gob distributor. There is a
                     high current trip, and a low current trip. <ol id="ol_ozf_shg_rzb">
                        <li>Approximate guidelines for the feeder: The high current setpoint should
                           be at 3 amps above the operating current, and the low current setpoint
                           should be at 3 amps below the operating current.</li>
                        <li>Approximate guidelines for the gob distributor: The high current
                           setpoint should be at 2 amps above the operating current, and the low
                           current setpoint should be at 2 amps below the operating current.</li>
                        <li>These setpoints can be adjusted to be closer to, or farther from, the
                           operating current depending on the mechanical cam and the motor current
                           variation.</li>
                        <li>The operating current should be observed and the setpoints set, based on
                           the amount of fluctuation in the current.</li>
                        <li>Adjustments may be required due to shear cam changes during job
                           changes</li>
                     </ol>
                  </li>
                  <li>If there are Servo Needles, Servo Shears, and/or Servo Gob Distributor
                     installed, there is a chute enable relay on the SDFL Interface board
                     (SCS-0314). This relay enables the chute to go up if the Needles, Shears, or
                     Gob Distributor stop for any reason. <ol id="ol_nl2_thg_rzb">
                        <li>There is also a pressure switch (OIS-204-665) used to monitor the air
                           supplied to the lockout solenoid valve. Calibrate test this switch, and
                           then set it at 3.1 bar (45 psi).</li>
                     </ol>
                  </li>
               </ol>
            </li>
            <li>To test the chute control system, perform the following steps:
         <ol>
                  <li>Lower the tube down to shut off the glass flow.  Then plug the orifice to ensure that glass will not flow.</li>
                  <li>Start the feeder, shears, and gob distributor</li>
                  <li id="li_dnz_23g_rzb">Place the chute control system in operating mode. To operate the
                     chute control system in operating mode, perform the following sequence <ol id="ol_gnz_23g_rzb">
                        <li>Bring the funnels into the glass.</li>
                        <li>Bring the reject cylinder into the glass.</li>
