                        <li>Ladders shall be properly mounted or chained to prevent tipping hazards or tripping hazards when not in use.</li>
                     </ol>
                  </li>

                        <li>A portable ladder shall, where possible, be used at such a pitch that the horizontal distance from the top support to the foot of the ladder is one-quarter of the working length (the length along the ladder between the bottom and the top support) of the ladder. 
                     <ol>
                              <li>i.e. For every four feet (1.2 m) up, the ladder needs to be one foot (30 cm) out (4:1 Rule).</li>
                           </ol>
                        </li>
                        <li>A ladder shall be so placed as to prevent slipping, or it shall be either lashed or held into position.</li>
                        <li>The ladder base section must be placed with a secure footing.  Ladders shall not be placed on boxes, barrels, or other unstable bases to obtain additional height.</li>
                        <li>The top of the ladder must be placed with the two rails supported, unless equipped with a single support attachment.</li>
                        <li>On two-section extension ladders, the minimum overlap for the two sections in use shall be as follows:

                        <li>Short ladders shall not be spliced together to provide long sections.</li>
                        <li>A ladder used to gain access to a roof shall extend at least 3 feet (1 m) above the point of support, at eave, gutter, or roofline.</li>
                        <li>Ladders shall not be used in a horizontal position as platforms, runways, or scaffolds.</li>
                        <li>Ladders shall not be placed in front of doors opening towards the ladder unless the door is blocked open, locked or guarded.</li>
                        <li>The top two steps of ordinary stepladders shall not be used.</li>
                        <li>Ladders shall not be used by more than one person at a time unless they are specifically designed for such use.</li>
                        <li>When ascending or descending, the climber must face the ladder and keep their hands free of tools or other objects.</li>
                        <li>Only ladders manufactured with non-conductive materials shall be utilized where contact is possible with exposed live electrical equipment or conductors.</li>
                        <li>Only properly rated ladders shall be used for each work situation.  Ladders shall display their load capacity and shall not be overloaded.  The North American ladder ratings below indicate the maximum total weight a specifically rated ladder will support, while the European classifications indicated the duty rating, the maximum static vertical load, and the application.
