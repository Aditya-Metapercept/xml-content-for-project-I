            <li>Bird Control<ol id="ol_dfw_5bj_nzb">
                  <li>Bird control can be difficult. Like rodent control, bird control should
                     incorporate an integrated pest management approach. Many quick fix ideas have
                     been developed, with very few showing any degree of long-term success. Some of
                     these control measures include the use of noisemakers, flashing lights,
                     imitation owls or snakes, sticky roosts, etc. The most successful bird control
                     programs include the following:<ol id="ol_ijd_wbj_nzb">
                        <li>Regular removal and destruction of all nests of resident birds. The
                           removal program should be ongoing to prevent the building of new nests.
                           Persistence is required, and several nest removal/rebuilding cycles may
                           be necessary before the birds will become discouraged and vacate the
                           area.</li>
                        <li>Bird droppings must be promptly cleaned up upon discovery, and increased
                           surveillance must take place to prevent recurrence.<ol id="ol_ldy_ybj_nzb">
                              <li>Bird droppings can present significant health problems. Consult
                                 the local pest control operator or a professional industrial
                                 cleaning service if extensive cleanup is necessary.</li>
