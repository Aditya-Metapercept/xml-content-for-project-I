                        <li>Good work practices to manage waste batch material (the
                  handling of waste batch material can be problematic - fugitive emissions and
                  spills).</li>
                        <li>Periodic inspections of the unloading process to confirm that
                  fugitive dust during unloading is not going across the property line.</li>
                        <li>Comply with any permit conditions regarding fugitive emissions
                  in the raw material unloading and handling process and within the Batch House.<p>
                              <u>Within the Batch House</u>
                           </p>
                        </li>
                        <li>Conduct a periodic inspection of each filter sock and dust
                  collector that is used in the Batch House.</li>
                        <li>Promptly perform corrective actions to remedy the situation (no

                              <u>Modifications</u>
                           </p>
                        </li>
                        <li>Do not add equipment or replace existing equipment in the Batch
                  House without determining the need for a permit or permit modification.</li>
                     </ol>
                  </p>
               </li>
               <li>All plants shall develop and manage procedures in compliance with the
              EHS Waste Management Fundamental as required by specific job duties. The
            procedure shall include the following Batch House specific requirements:<ol id="ol_o4d_cqs_4zb">
                     <li>Properly characterize all hazardous and non-hazardous materials
                and ensure they are kept separate. <u>Waste batch and cullet </u>will require
                additional management if they are a hazardous waste. Do not mix hazardous and
                non-hazardous waste. </li>
                     <li>Housekeeping of outside batch area is critical to overall waste
                management compliance. This area should be regularly swept with equipment capable of
                vacuuming, wetting and collecting material during sweeping operation. Dry sweeping
                is prohibited. The waste should be separated as needed. Where sweeping is not
                possible, spilled raw material and batch should be shoveled up or otherwise removed
                promptly.</li>
                     <li>Provide appropriate storage areas to handle waste batch, waste
                cullet and basement cullet. Do not typically mix wastes together or add construction
                and miscellaneous debris to designated waste areas.</li>
                  </ol>
               </li>
               <li>All plants shall develop and manage procedures in compliance with the
              EHS Storm Water Pollution Prevention Plan Fundamental (SWPPP) as required by
            specific job duties. The procedure shall include the following Batch House specific
              requirements:<ol id="ol_bbp_dqs_4zb">
                     <li>The batch/raw material transfer conveyer and elevator should be
                contained/covered to minimize leakage, routinely inspected for proper operations
                including routinely checking for proper tracking and leakage should be promptly
                cleaned up.</li>
                     <li>The raw material unloading area should be swept after each raw
                material delivery and vacuumed as needed. Measures should be taken to minimize wind
                from blowing material around.</li>
                     <li>Need to control water run off (dry weather and storm water) from
                basement cullet outside bunkers. Operations should consolidate storage area, protect
                area from storm water, and direct runoff back to basement for reuse.</li>
                     <li>Ensure that a dust collector system is utilized, as needed, to
                control fugitive dust from various operations to protect these materials from storm
                water impact, waste management concerns and air permit concerns.</li>
                  </ol>
               </li>
               <li>All plants shall develop and manage oil management procedures
            in compliance with the EHS Spill Prevention Control and Countermeasure Plan
              (SPCC) and implement best management practices as required by specific job
            duties.</li>
               <li>All plants shall develop and manage asbestos procedures in
            compliance with the EHS Asbestos Management Plan guidance as required by specific
            job duties. The procedure shall include the following Batch House specific
              requirements:<ol id="ol_rzq_nqs_4zb">
                     <li>Follow “Do Not Disturb” instructions/signs near any asbestos
                containing materials commonly found in window caulking and paint at the Batch
                House.</li>
                  </ol>
                  <p>
                     <u>Health</u>
                  </p>
                  <p>Respirable Crystalline
              Silica (RCS) is one of the most impactful health concerns relative to Space Batch
              Houses. RCS primarily comes from the sand portion of the batch mix, which can become
              airborne anytime the batch material is not contained and/or disturbed during the
              process, cleaning, or maintenance activities. Airborne concentrations must be
              evaluated and controls put in place according to the Global EHS Respirable Silica
              Fundamental EHS-06-004.</p>
               </li>
               <li>Each facility shall conduct a respirable crystalline silica (RCS)
            exposure assessment to determine the potential for employee exposure to RCS. The
            assessment shall be based on the potential RCS airborne concentrations for the jobs and
            tasks of similar exposure groups (SEGs).</li>
               <li>Each facility shall prepare a sampling plan based upon the exposure
            assessment and the plan should cover planned sampling activities over the next 24 to 36
            months.</li>
               <li>The assessment and sampling plan must be completed by a person
            competent in the practice of industrial hygiene.</li>
               <li>Each facility shall institute a RCS medical surveillance program for
            all employees who are routinely exposed (i.e., 30 days per year) over the occupational
            (OEL) based on the results from the exposure assessment and the sampling plan.</li>
               <li>Each facility shall have an exposure control plan, or its equivalent.
            An example is shown in Appendix B6 of EHS-06-004. The written plan shall contain the
            following elements:<ol id="ol_sx3_qrs_4zb">
                     <li>A description of the workplace tasks that involve exposure to
                respirable crystalline silica.</li>
                     <li>A description of the engineering controls, work practices, and
                respiratory protection used to limit employee exposure to respirable crystalline
                silica for each task.</li>
                     <li>A description of the housekeeping measures used to limit employee
                exposure to respirable crystalline silica, such as not allowing dry sweeping or the
                use of compressed air, and the use of dust suppressant and vacuum systems with HEPA
                filter collection.</li>
                  </ol>
               </li>
               <li>Regulated areas shall be established wherever exposure to airborne
            concentrations of RCS is (or can reasonably be expected to be) in excess of the
            local/regional legal exposure limit, as adjusted for extended shifts. The regulated area
            must be marked, have limited access, and proper PPE must be worn to enter, which will
            include proper respiratory protection.</li>
               <li>Airborne RCS and accumulations of dust shall be reduced by following
            good housekeeping practices and reporting leaks/spills to a supervisor. When completing
            Batch House housekeeping, the following methods shall be employed in the following
            preferred order:<ol id="ol_bq1_zrs_4zb">
                     <li>High-efficiency particulate air filter (HEPA) vacuuming shall be
                the preferred method and shall be used where practical.<ol id="ol_un2_1ss_4zb">
                           <li>When central vacuum equipment is used, it should be evaluated
                    to confirm proper function following the form shown in Appendix B9 (or its
                    equivalent) shall be completed to evaluate the Batch House equipment
                    performance.</li>
                        </ol>
                     </li>
                     <li>If HEPA vacuuming is not practical, a wet method shall be
                  used.<ol id="ol_tzt_2ss_4zb">
                           <li>Floor sweep absorbents and other methods shall be applied.
                    DRY SWEEPING IS PROHIBITED!</li>
                        </ol>
                     </li>
                     <li>If the shoveling of material is necessary, respiratory protection
                and Tyvek (or a regional equivalent) coverall is required to keep dust off of
                clothing. To reduce potential dusting when shoveling, material shall be placed in a
                container or in a chute instead of forceful throwing.</li>
                     <li>Compressed air shall not be used wherever it could disturb dust
                (i.e., not to clean or to blow off clothing).</li>
                  </ol>
               </li>
               <li>The hierarchy of controls must be followed relative to RCS exposure.
            Engineering controls must be considered before the use of PPE. The RCS fundamental
            contains an internal Engineering Design Standard for new batch projects of 25 µg/m3
            8-hour TWA. <p>Noise exposure in a Batch House is often greater than
              the applicable occupational exposure limits. Batch House employee are typically
              included in the site hearing conservation program. The requirements of the Hearing
              Conservation Program are contained in EHS-02-133.</p>
               </li>
               <li>Each facility shall be complete an assessment and develop a sampling
            plan to evaluate employees potential exposure to noise in the Batch House and to
            identify employees for inclusion in the Hearing Conservation Program (HCP). All persons
            working in areas or with equipment that have noise levels equal to or exceeding 85
            decibels (dB) as an 8-hour time-weighted average (TWA), or any locally more stringent
            legal limit, must be included in the HCP.</li>
               <li>Employees included in the HCP must receive medical surveillance and
            audiograms according to the Country Group or locally more stringent requirements. This
            typically includes initial tests and periodic retests such as annually.</li>
               <li>The hierarchy of controls must be followed when levels exceed 85 dBA
            or a locally more stringent limit. Engineering controls, followed by administrative
            controls must be considered before choosing PPE as the last choice. </li>
               <li>When choosing hearing protection devices (HPDs), the site must
            document that hearing protection is adequate based on the assessed noise levels and the
            local legal requirements.</li>
               <li>Signs must be posted indicating the need for PPE where HPDs are
            required. Signs must meet local legal requirements.</li>
               <li>Employees must receive documented initial and annual noise training.
            Training shall include the risks of elevated noise exposure and proper use of hearing
            protection, at a minimum. <p>Respiratory protection is required in the
              Batch House when engineering and administrative controls fail to control RCS (and
              sometimes other contaminants) below occupational exposure limits and sometimes during
              the completion of specified tasks. The requirements of the Global Respiratory
              Protection Fundamental is contained in EHS-06-009.</p>
               </li>
               <li>Each site must complete an assessment to determine where respiratory
            protection is required and select the proper respirators based upon that assessment. The
            assessment will take into account exposure monitoring that is completed as part of the
            sites IH assessment and sampling plan.</li>
               <li>Before wearing a respirator, employees must receive a medical
            approval or fit for work certificate signifying the employee can wear a respirator in
            accordance to EHS-06-009.</li>
               <li>Negative pressure respirators (i.e., filtering face piece, half and
            full face cartridge) respirators require the user to have a documented fit test before
            initial use and periodically after in accordance to EHS-06-009.</li>
               <li>Each site must have a policy in place requiring that nothing
            (including facial hair) interfere with the seal of a negative pressure respirator. A
            positive pressure respirator (i.e., PAPR) that does not rely on a facial seal can be
            worn where compliance cannot be met with the use of a negative pressure respirator.</li>
               <li>Respirators must be properly maintained, stored, discarded, and have
            a documented cartridge change schedule. The cartridge change schedule is based upon the
            contaminate levels in the work area and indicates when the cartridge should be
            changed.</li>
               <li>The requirement to wear a respirator must be posted on signs in the
            work area and/or work area entrance.</li>
               <li>Employees must receive annual respiratory protection training that
            meets local regulatory requirements and the requirements contained in EHS-06-009.<p>Temperature extremes in a the Batch House varies based on the sites
              location and seasonal changes. Each site must assess the potential temperature
              extremes and implement actions as necessary in compliance with Heat Related Illness
              EHS-02-134.</p>
               </li>
               <li>Each site must complete an assessment to identify employees and tasks
            that put employees at risk for heat stress. The assessment must meet the requirements
            contained in EHS-02-134 or the local legal requirements if more stringent. </li>
               <li>A written site specific program should be available detailing how the
            site manages areas or tasks identified at risk during the assessment.</li>
               <li>When areas or tasks are identified at risk, then additional
            provisions for water consumption and cooling areas must be provided per EHS-02-134.</li>
               <li>Medical surveillance must be implemented where there is a local legal
            requirement.</li>
               <li>Documented training must be provided annually for all supervisors of
            employees and employees who have been identified at risk during the assessment. The
            training must cover, as a minimum, all of the topics contained in EHS-02-134 and as
            locally required. <p>The Batch House has a number of raw materials and
              other chemicals available for use with potentials for personal employee exposure and
              exposure to the environment. Each site must ensure the safe and proper use of
              hazardous and nonhazardous chemicals and must comply with locally applicable
              regulations addressing the storage and disposal of these chemicals, and the
              requirements contained in Chemical Management EHS-02-123.</p>
