                     </ol>
                  </li>
                  <li>Watch Floor Surfaces<ol>
                        <li>Regular inspection for hazards such as floor deterioration, material accumulation and water or oil buildup. </li>

                           Environmental, Health and Safety.</li>

                  </li>

                        <li>Regularly clear out storage areas to confirm equipment is still in good working order and is accounted for. Discard broken equipment or expired materials.</li>
                        <li>Ensure heavy objects are not stored overhead, or if overhead storage is
                           required, the objects are secured in place. <fig>

                  </li>
                  <li>Keep Up with Maintenance
            <ol>
                        <li>The Batch House is full of machines and equipment requiring regular maintenance.</li>
