         <title>Purpose</title>
         <p>To define a work instruction for the proper Isolation and Lockout Tagout Tryout of
            energy isolating devices, switches, or sources whenever maintenance or servicing is done
            on machines or equipment, in accordance with local regulatory requirements. This work
            instruction is used to ensure that the machine or equipment being worked on is stopped
            and isolated from all potentially hazardous energy sources, locked and tagged out before
            employees perform any servicing, modifications, or maintenance where release of stored
            energy could cause injury.</p>

      <section id="section_jkd_tgq_pzb">
         <title>Application</title>
         <p>This work instruction applies to all work operations where employees must deal with
            Lockout Tagout Tryout situations as part of their job duties. Trouble shooting which
            requires energized sources is permitted by authorized employees but proper Lockout
            Tagout Tryout procedures must be utilized upon working on, modifying, or servicing any
            machine or equipment.</p>
         <p>This work instruction applies to a company <i>authorized employee</i> who is
            trained to implement a Lockout Tagout Tryout procedure on machines or equipment to
            perform servicing or maintenance. The authorized employee knows and understands the
            types, magnitudes, and hazards of energy sources they work around or with. The
            authorized employee has been properly trained to Lockout Tagout Tryout and tryout all
            equipment and is permitted to troubleshoot.</p>
