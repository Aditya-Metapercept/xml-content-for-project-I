            <li>Charging or refueling of mobile equipment must be performed by a competent person and in an area designated for that purpose.</li>
            <li>Applicable safety equipment must be worn, such as seat belts, when operating forklifts and wheel/steer loaders as well as body harnesses with tie-offs when operating boom and scissor type manlifts.</li>
            <li>Operators must not use personal mobile/handheld communication devices whilst operating mobile equipment.</li>
            <li>Operators shall report all hazards, near misses, and incidents regardless of fault or severity.</li>
            <li>Operators must be aware of overhead clearance and overhead objects such as ceilings, cable trays, pipe work, supporting beams, electrical cabling, lights, and fire suppression systems.</li>
            <li>Passengers are not to ride the mobile equipment at any time, unless the equipment is designed to carry more than one person.</li>
            <li>Mobile equipment must be clearly visible and audible by persons on foot. Operators must alert employees in the area especially when entering or exiting a building, turning, or reversing by means of reverse alarm, horn, headlights, and flashing beacons.</li>
            <li>Always travel with platforms lowered, or so that a load may not obstruct the view from the operator’s seat.</li>
            <li>Site speed limits must be adhered to at all times.</li>
            <li>Mobile equipment must not be left unattended by the operator without engaging the parking brake, lowering the load, and shutting off the engine and removing the key.</li>
            <li>All mobile equipment cabs must be fitted with suitable protection to protect drivers from falling objects and materials.</li>
            <li>Operators of mobile equipment must always give priority to pedestrians and stop at crossings, respecting the Space property at all times.</li>
            <li>Operators must always look in the direction of travel when driving mobile equipment (e.g. if reversing, operators must look over their shoulder).</li>
            <li>Operators must not drive whilst taking a course of medication that could impair their judgement. Operators must inform their direct supervisor of any medication they have been prescribed so an assessment can be conducted.</li>
