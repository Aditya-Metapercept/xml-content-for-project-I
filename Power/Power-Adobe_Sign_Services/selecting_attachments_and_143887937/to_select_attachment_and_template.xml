            <p>Sending Documents with Related Agreements</p>
            <p>Adobe Sign Services enables you to select attachments from the
               related/sibling/parent/child agreements as well. This feature is controlled by the
                  <uicontrol>Hide Related Agreement Selection</uicontrol> custom setting in
                  <uicontrol>Apttus-Adobe eSignature Properties</uicontrol>. To ensure that the
               signed documents are returned back to the respective related/sibling/parent/child
               agreement records, you must add the Attachment Trigger custom code in your
               Salesforce org.</p>
            <p>The table below represents the scenarios and behavior of various custom settings. The following custom settings might affect your system, collectively. </p>
