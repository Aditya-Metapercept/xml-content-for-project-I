      <p>To Amend an Agreement, go to an Activated agreement, click the Amend button.</p>
      <p>The original agreement status is updated to Being Amended and is still In Effect until the new version of the agreement is Activated. The latest version of the Agreement status is set to In Amendment.</p>
      <p>Programs are amended individually within an agreement. You may have multiple programs associated to a single agreement and only need to amend a single program. Select the Amend action on the Kabob menu from the program listed in the program tab to amend a program, as shown in the below image.</p>
      <p>When the Amend Program action is performed the Agreement and Program being amended are versioned. Any other program associated to the agreement is left in its original status. You can view all programs associated with the prior version of the agreement in the latest agreement.</p>

      </p>
      <p>The original program is left in an Activated status until the new version of the program is Activated. This way, the calculation will continue for the original version. When the latest version of the program is Activated after being amended, the prior version of the program is set to Terminated.</p>
      <p>Agreements and Programs can be amended as many times as needed – there is no restriction.</p>
      <p>After an amended program is set to Activated, Open schedules are regenerated and recalculated based on the latest program definition. Many fields are disabled once the program is activated. Only certain fields are editable when the program is In Amendment.</p>
      <p>The following fields are not editable when the program is in an Activated status or when In Amendment using out of the box configuration:</p>
      <ul>
         <li>Program Start Date</li>
         <li>Account</li>
         <li>Agreement ID</li>
         <li>Account Type</li>
         <li>Data Source</li>
         <li>Default Qualification Formula</li>

         <li>Billing Frequency</li>
         <li>Billing Rule</li>
         <li>Program Schedule Day</li>
      </ul>
      <p>The following program fields are editable when the program is In Amendment status:</p>
      <ul>
         <li>Label</li>
         <li>Description</li>
         <li>Program End Date</li>
