      <p>The Temperature Screen shows the trend graph of the calculated bottle temperature and the relative temperature of the bottle.</p>
      <p>The temperature is calculated using the radiation coming from the bottle. The emissivity is a fixed setting and cannot be changed. That means the temperature is not an absolute glass temperature, but just shows the trend of the temperature for the complete bottle.</p>
      <p>The relative temperature is the temperature difference between the measured temperature and
         the temperature that it is expected the bottle should have. The expected temperature is
         calculated by using the cooling of the bottle on the conveyor.<image href="media/image10.jpg"
