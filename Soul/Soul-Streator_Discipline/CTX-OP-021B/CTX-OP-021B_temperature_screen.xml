      <p>The Temperature screen shows the calculated temperatures of the glass bottles at the camera position.</p>
      <p>The Temperature calculation depends on the glass emissivity which depends on the glass color and glass thickness. The emissivity is fixed in the system.  The calculated temperature can differ from the real glass temperature when the emissivity is not correct.</p>
      <p>The Relative Temperature graph shows the difference between the measured temperature and the fit line in the upper graph. The fit line is the temperature you would expect if the bottles leave the section with the same temperature but are cooled down on the conveyor.</p>
      <p>The Relative Temperature can be used to correct/minimize temperature differences between
         sections and to find problems with the cooling.<fig id="fig_bfz_mxj_fcc">
