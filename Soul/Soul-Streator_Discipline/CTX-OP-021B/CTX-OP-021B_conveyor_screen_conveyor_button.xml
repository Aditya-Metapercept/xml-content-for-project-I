      <p>The top graph (Conveyor speed) shows the speed that is measured by the system. <ul id="ul_kmv_vwj_fcc">
            <li>The speed is calculated by measuring the time it takes for a bottle to move from the
               first camera to the second, using with the known distance between the cameras.</li>
            <li>The theoretical conveyor speed is also calculated using the 'Belt Advance' setting
               and the machine cycle time.</li>
         </ul>
      </p>
      <p>The second graph (Relative Conveyor Speed) shows the measured conveyor speed is 98.6% of
         the theoretical conveyor speed. <ul id="ul_z2t_xwj_fcc">
            <li>This means that the belt is going 1.4% slower than the theoretical conveyor
               speed.</li>
            <li>The spikes in the graphs can be caused by bottles which are not placed correctly on
               the conveyor. These spikes should be ignored<fig id="fig_dtg_zwj_fcc">
